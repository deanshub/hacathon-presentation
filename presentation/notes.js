  <li>if I'm here to pitch a hackathon idea then, I'm sorry,</li>
  <li>you're wasting my time</li>
  <li>and worse, I'm wasting yours</li>
  <li>So, I'm not...</li>
  <li>I'm here to show you the future of Sisense</li>
</ul>`,
  world: `<ul>
  <li>This is what we're trying to solve</li>
  <li>70% of our clients don't use Sisense!</li>
  <li>We know we can sell sisense, but we want more</li>
  <li>We want a product that is being used</li>
  <li>every single day!</li>
  <ul/>`,
  problem: `<ul>
  <li>We want to turn this</li>
</ul>`,
  solution: `<ul>
  <li>into this</li>
  <li>so without further ado</li>
</ul>`,
  tech: `<ul>
  <li>How it works? glad you asked!</li>
  <li>It uses the latest machine learning tech that use entity extraction algorithms</li>
  <li>and a chome extention that is using sisense js</li>
</ul>`,
  future: `<ul>
  <li>We tried it with Alexa and Bulby</li>
  <li>but this is a new kind of adoption,</li>
  <li>it flows into every work enviroment that you're already using</li>
  <li>And also</li>
  <li>with this we can finally get to learn where our users need us the most</li>
</ul>`,
  action: `<ul>
  <li>I have started using this a week ago</li>
  <li>and I already feel naked without it</li>
  <li>no words can compare to personal experience,</li>
  <li>so I decided to give you a gift,</li>
  <li>when I click this button you will all receive an email with the extention and a description on how to install it</li>
  <li>Let Black & Yellow take you to Sisense's future</li>
</ul>`,
